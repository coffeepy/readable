This is for my own explanation.

We do have the backend server, so why redux?

Well remember the App has the state, that state will be what is given by the backend
You will load the entire frontend etc.. based on the state.

State gets harder to get access to unless we have a centralized store.

You want to implement redux asap, so we use that as our single source.

We will also want to use middleware to catch the actions before they update the store,
so it will update the backend first!, if we update the backend first, i dont see a reason to update the
store, unless we update the store and dont update the backend unless there's a refresh, adding caching
ability....kinda like that...but will that be possible. Will state only be set when the App is loaded the
first time, is that really possible...hmmmmmmm
